# Risc-v-Emulator
University assignment:

Your task is to develop a processor emulator using the C programming language.

The processor emulator is intended to simulate machine instructions of the 
RISC-V architecture. Subsequently, a RISC-V program is to be executed on the emulator.
In digital computing systems, information is represented solely by two states. 
These two states are symbolized by the digits 0 and 1 and are referred to as "binary digits" or simply "bits."
A sequence of n bits, capable of being processed in the arithmetic-logical unit of a processor, is referred to as a "data word" or "binary word."
In the case of a processor understanding the RV32I instruction set, data words consist of 32 bits.
